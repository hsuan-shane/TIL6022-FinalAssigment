    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Netherlands is a country known for its efficient transportation system and its dynamic weather patterns. The interplay between these two elements often goes unnoticed, yet it has a profound impact on the daily routines and travel behaviors of its residents. Understanding how weather influences travel behavior holds practical significance for transportation planning and climate adaptation. This report delves into the relationship between weather conditions and travel choices, seeking to answer critical questionsabout how the Dutch people adapt their travel behaviors in response to varying weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study focuses on two primary domains: public transportation and road traffic. We aim to explore the extent to which these weather variables impact the number of passengers using public transport services, as recorded through OV chipcard check-ins. Additionally, we seek to ascertain how these weather conditions affect road traffic, with a particular emphasis on traffic congestion. Moreover, we aim to investigate potential variations in travel behavior between urban and rural areas, recognizing that the geography and infrastructure of different regions may shape the choices people make when it comes to commuting."
